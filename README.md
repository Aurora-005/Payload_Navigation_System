# Payload_Navigation_System
The project implements a real-time vision-based system on Raspberry Pi to estimate altitude and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) using ORB feature tracking and mesh-based scaling, offering a low-cost, sensor-free solution for drones or rockets with reliable performance at 10â€“15 FPS.
